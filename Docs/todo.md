    After reading through the task description, decisioin to adapt previously allocated tasks:
    
    Claudia: main work on documentation and theory
             - input on grid layout (alternative) + function to check for a winner which covers all directions 
             - research how to enhance computer opponent in single player mode

- Single Player
- Multiplayer
- Unit Test

Research and test programming outside the repository

    Repository created (Thomas), cloned and branched. Starting work on branch: bits and pieces from test programming added.
    Thomas: takes over single player mode plus research on how to make the opponent stronger
    Claudia: multi player mode + control functions (winner, empty slots etc.)
